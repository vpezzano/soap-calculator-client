# Example of SOAP client.
I am connnecting to a SOAP end-point to make some simple calculations. The wsdl is: http://www.dneonline.com/calculator.asmx?WSDL
The file ServiceEndPointInterfaceGenerator.bat creates (and explains how to do it) the Service End Point interface used in the class
SoapCalculatorClient. The generated files are wrapped in a jar using the script JarCreator.bat.
